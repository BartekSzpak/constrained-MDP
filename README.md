# Constrained MDP

![Robot navigation domain](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vgSdn7OHV3E0VHmnVgUVrfBMtj8ybfIO5wQShNt61C3-V2KfajgtKYTZCJKIOGf60FdgwNDU90xwcu4fEeaYDbmsGMnpRDZ72moO-CXbSVcqkiaGaQ=w371)

This codebase contains the following.

* Factored MDP formulation and some tabular domains.
* Linear programming methods to find constrained-optimal policies in MDPs (using Gurobi or CPLEX).
* Query selection algorithms in my research.

This is mostly for my own research use. See more details in my homepage below.
