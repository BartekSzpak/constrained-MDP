This codebase contains the following.

* Factored MDP formulation and some tabular domains.
* Linear programming methods to find constrained-optimal policies in MDPs (using Gurobi or CPLEX).
* Query selection algorithms in my research.

This is mostly for my own research use. See more details in my homepage below.
